# **Welcome to IoT Core v 2.1!**


**We are feeling proud to announce our version 2.1, which brings numerous functionalites like:**
1.  Master-slave concept between Arduino-Arduino.
2.  LCD module compatibility with 16x2 LCD.
3.  Live temperature of the room environment (with the help of LM35).

To be able to use this code, **2 Arduino UNOs or 1 uno + 1 nano is required.**

## **Steps to get a working BrainNet IoT Core:**

1.  Flash IoT_helper.ino to one of the arduino (preferred is nano).
2.  Flash ESP_Controller.ino to Arduino UNO.
3.  Connect A4 and A5 of both arduinos.
4.  Connect LCD module and LM35 to nano.
  
Enjoy the power of IoT core, powered by BrainNet Technologies.
